# Flight-Delay-Prediction-Neural-Networks-Project
•Developed an engaging rocket game where players navigate a rocket to avoid dynamically spawning obstacles.

•Implemented object-oriented programming principles to structure game components, such as player controls,
collision detection, and score increment.

•Enhanced user experience by creating a responsive scoring system that rewarded successful avoidance maneuvers.

•Improved debugging and design skills through iterative testing and performance optimization.
