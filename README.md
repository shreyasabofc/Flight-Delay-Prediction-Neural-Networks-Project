Project Overview

Flight delays significantly impact airline operations, passenger experience, and resource planning. This project focuses on building a data-driven predictive model to estimate the likelihood of flight delays using real-world aviation data. The objective is to demonstrate how machine learning–based predictive analytics can support operational decision-making in the air travel domain.

A neural network–based approach was implemented to learn complex, non-linear relationships between flight attributes and delay outcomes, achieving strong predictive performance on unseen data.
